# Weather Forecast

In this repo I will develop a Weather Forecast set of tools.

spider.py is (my first) spider which crawls over the Aemet observation stations and downloads all the available data.

Other scripts to visualize are being developed.

Fully connected or LSTM Neural Networks will be used to actuall predictions

## Dependencies
pandas package is used to handle the data and save/load to files taking care of repetitions, nans...


pandas can be simple installed as

sudo apt-get install python3-pandas


## TO-DO
- [ ] log level should go to info
- [ ] parser/header in the functions should be self-contained
- [ ] Clean the repository of old/useless scripts
- [ ] Use pandas in the plotting scripts
